So what does Purist do? Shorten URLs, that's what it does. Although in the actual code
it's referred to as URIs, get it right.

It uses the web.py framework (http://webpy.org). For data storage it uses SQLite 3 and
memcached. You can use it without memcached, but you still need the Python module at the
moment.

A database (uris.db) is included with some sample data so you can get started right away.

And it's MIT licensed. So there.
